  "The JIT and the runtime's hooks into the translator. Loading a class
  defines every method as a stub; the first call to a stub calls back into
  jit!, which translates that one method (or loads its cached code) and
  redefines the global in place. That mirrors OpenLDK, which also compiles
  each method on first call. The hooks answer helpful NPE messages, a
  frame's source file and line, class path lookups for misnamed classes and
  constant pool entries."
